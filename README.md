## Calculator Project - Frontend Masters Complete Intro to Web Dev V3

To stretch my CSS skills I created a design in Figma taking inspiration from some Teenage Engineering products to try and make the calculator feel a bit more releastic. This is for sure not my speciality when it comes to design but it has been fun to get a better understanding of how designers create photo releastic objects by using simple vectors, shadows, color, and opacity.

Below is an image of the end goal and a link to the [Figma design here](https://www.figma.com/file/fajda74laDj9KrCTOT2tPX/Calculator?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=uUYMmJLssoqXPNhd-1).
